# django-htmx-forms

A Django helper app to add editing capabilities to the frontend using Django, HTMX and modal forms.

Bases on my previous somehow incomplete researches as documented here:

- [Editing Django models in the front end](https://editing-django-models-in-the-frontend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Django Frontend Forms](https://github.com/morlandi/django-frontend-forms)
